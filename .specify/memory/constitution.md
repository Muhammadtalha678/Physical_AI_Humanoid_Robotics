# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
All content must prioritize clarity, accuracy, and accessibility for learners at various levels of expertise in humanoid robotics. Educational materials must be well-structured, pedagogically sound, and include practical examples with theoretical foundations.

### II. Specification-Driven Development
All development follows the Spec-Kit Plus methodology with Claude Code AI assistance. Every feature and content piece must have a clear specification before implementation, ensuring alignment with learning objectives and technical requirements.

### III. Docusaurus-Based Documentation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All textbook content is built using Docusaurus framework for consistency, searchability, and maintainability. All content must follow Docusaurus standards for structure, styling, and deployment to GitHub Pages.

### IV. AI-Assisted Development
Leverage Claude Code and AI tools for all development tasks to accelerate creation, maintain quality, and ensure consistency. All AI-generated content must be reviewed and validated by domain experts.

### V. Open Source and Accessibility
All learning materials must be freely accessible via GitHub Pages, with source code available for community contribution. Content must be designed for global accessibility standards and inclusive learning.

### VI. Technical Accuracy and Verification
All technical content related to humanoid robotics must be factually accurate, verified by domain experts, and regularly updated to reflect current research and industry standards.

### VII. Interactive Chatbot Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
An AI-powered chatbot using Chatkit library must be integrated into all pages of the Docusaurus-based textbook. The chatbot interface shall appear in the bottom-right corner of every page, providing consistent user interaction and support. The chatbot must handle proper request-response cycles, maintain conversation context, and provide helpful responses related to the textbook content and humanoid robotics topics.

## Content Standards

All textbook materials must meet rigorous academic and technical standards. Content should include mathematical foundations, practical implementations, real-world applications, and hands-on exercises. Each chapter must include learning objectives, key concepts, and assessment materials.

## Development Workflow

Development follows the Spec-Kit Plus workflow: Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Review. All changes require peer review, automated testing where applicable, and compliance verification with this constitution. Deployment occurs via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documentation of rationale, community review, and approval by project maintainers. All pull requests must verify compliance with these principles.
