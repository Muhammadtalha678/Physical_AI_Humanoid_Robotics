# Specification Creation: Chatbot UI Integration

## PROMPT_TEXT
```
Add the ui of chatbot inside the docasarus project which are inside the docs folder using chatkit
   libraray. The chatbot show on  the bottom right of every page of website. The chatbot handling the proper request response.
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created a comprehensive specification for integrating a chatbot UI into the Docusaurus documentation project. The spec includes three prioritized user stories focusing on UI display, basic chat interaction, and context-aware responses. Ten functional requirements were defined covering UI display, message handling, and system behavior. Success criteria include measurable outcomes like response time and user satisfaction metrics. The spec was validated for quality and a checklist was created.

## Outcome
Successfully created a complete specification for the chatbot UI integration feature with all required sections: user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria. The specification follows best practices with technology-agnostic success criteria and testable requirements.

## Evaluation
The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. All validation criteria were met, and the quality checklist confirms the spec is ready for development planning.
